User Story: Capture and Display Client Email Communications
As a Training Manager,
I want to automatically capture and display all email communications between clients, training managers, and trainers,
so that the entire project team can see a complete communication history within the training engagement record and ensure context, accountability, and transparency.

Given / When / Then
Given:

There is an active or completed training request / engagement in the system.

Email exchanges occur between any of the following parties:

Client / Sponsor

Training Manager

Trainer(s)

Administrator

When:

An email is sent to or from an address associated with the engagement (e.g., the client’s email or training manager’s email),

Or an authorized user uploads / forwards an email thread into the system,

Then:

The system automatically (or via manual upload) captures the email content, including:

Sender Name and Email Address

Recipient(s)

Date and Time Sent

Subject Line

Body (text)

Attachments (if any)

The captured email is displayed in the Communications History section of the training engagement, in chronological order with existing notes, calls, and meeting summaries.

Acceptance Criteria
✅ Capture Methods

The system can capture emails in one or more of the following ways:

Automatic sync~~ with organization’s email system (e.g., Gmail/Outlook API connection).~~

Manual upload via “Add Email Communication” button (paste or drag/drop .eml, .msg, or text).

Email forwarding alias (e.g., project123@trainingapp.ai) that automatically logs any forwarded email to that address.

Only emails associated with the engagement’s participants or designated alias are logged.

✅ Display & Organization

Captured emails are listed in a Communications History tab under the training request.

Each entry shows:

Sender, Recipients, Date, Subject (in summary view)

Full message body (expandable)

Attachments (downloadable if user has permission)

Emails are ordered newest to oldest, with filters for Sender, Type (Email / Call / Note), or Date Range.

Threaded conversations are grouped visually (like message chains).

✅ Security & Access Control

Only authorized team members (Training Manager, assigned Trainer, Admin) can view full email content.

Sensitive attachments or notes can be restricted to Admins or designated roles.

Email data is encrypted and stored in compliance with SOC2 requirements.

✅ Search & Traceability

Users can search by keyword, sender, or date within the Communications History.

Each email record links back to its related training request.

The system maintains an audit log of when each message was captured and by whom.

✅ Feedback & Validation

If a user uploads or forwards an invalid or duplicate email, the system provides an error or warning (e.g., “Email already logged”).

Upon successful capture, a message confirms:
“Email communication successfully recorded in engagement history.”

✅ Stretch Goals / Future Enhancements

AI summarization: Automatically generate short summaries of long threads.

Tagging: Users can tag emails as Client Decision, Change Request, FYI, etc.

Integration with Coordination Calls: Links between emails and related meeting notes.

Metrics Reporting: Analytics dashboard for total communications per engagement or response time tracking.
