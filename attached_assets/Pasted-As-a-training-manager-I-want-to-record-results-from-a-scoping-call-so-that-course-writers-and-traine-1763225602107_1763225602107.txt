As a training manager I want to record results from a scoping call so that course writers and trainers can see and refer back to sponsors requests.

Given:

There is an existing training request in the system.

I have conducted or am conducting a scoping call with the client.

When:

I select “Record Scoping Call” from the training request dashboard or details page.

Then:

I am presented with a fillable scoping call form that includes the following fields:

Attendee Roles: (e.g., Executives, Managers, Analysts, etc.)

Training Objectives: “At the end of the course, participants should be able to…” (Free-text)

Delivery Mode: (Dropdown – Virtual, On-site, Hybrid)

Duration: (e.g., 2 days, 3 hours)

Preferred Time Window for Delivery: (e.g., Q1 2025, next month, specific dates)

Number of Participants (Estimated)

Special Requirements / Constraints: (optional – e.g., technical setup, materials, language)

Notes / Additional Context: (free text for capturing qualitative details)

Additional Acceptance Criteria
✅ Form Functionality

The form fields are clearly labeled and accept appropriate data types (text, dropdown, date, number).

Required fields (e.g., Attendee Roles, Training Objectives, Delivery Mode) must be completed before submission.

Optional fields are visually indicated as such.

✅ Save & Edit

I can Save the form as a draft if I haven’t completed all fields.

I can Submit the final scoping call record when complete.

After submission, I can Edit or Update the record before the course development phase begins.

The system logs the date, time, and user who last modified the record.

✅ Integration & Visibility

Once saved, the scoping call record is attached to the related training request and accessible by course writers, trainers, and administrators.

Team members can view (read-only) the scoping call details from the training request page.

The record status is visible (e.g., “Scoping Call Recorded” or “Pending”).

✅ Validation & Feedback

If required fields are missing, the user receives a clear error message identifying which fields need attention.

A confirmation message is displayed after successful submission (e.g., “Scoping call details recorded successfully”).

A summary of the scoping call is created to copy and paste into an email to the client to ensure accuracy

✅ Audit & Versioning (Stretch Goal)

Previous versions of scoping call notes are retained for reference, showing changes over time.
