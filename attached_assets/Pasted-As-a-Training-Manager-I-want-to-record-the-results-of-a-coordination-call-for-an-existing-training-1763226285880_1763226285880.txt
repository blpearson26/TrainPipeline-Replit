As a Training Manager,
I want to record the results of a coordination call for an existing training request,
so that any additional client instructions, updates, or changes to the training plan are captured and shared with course writers, trainers, and logistics coordinators.

Given / When / Then
Given:

A training request already exists in the system with a scoping call record.

The client has scheduled or completed a coordination call (e.g., to finalize logistics, confirm participants, or clarify content).

When:

I select “Record Coordination Call” from the training request page or meeting summary tab.

Then:

I am presented with a fillable coordination call form that includes fields to capture:

Call Date / Time

Attendees and Roles (pre-populate from prior scoping call, allow edits/additions)

Purpose of Call (e.g., logistics update, additional content requests, instructor confirmation)

Summary of Discussion Points

New or Updated Training Objectives (if applicable)

Additional Materials or Resources Requested

Changes to Delivery Mode, Dates, or Duration

Follow-Up Actions and Responsible Parties

Notes / Client Instructions

Acceptance Criteria
✅ Form Behavior

The form loads pre-filled contextual data from the related training request (client name, course title, previous scoping summary).

All fields are editable and accept appropriate input types (text, dropdowns, date).

Required fields: Call Date / Time, Purpose of Call, Summary of Discussion Points.

Optional fields clearly indicated.

✅ Save, Submit & Edit

I can Save as Draft during the call and Submit when complete.

I can Edit or Update coordination notes until the training delivery begins.

The system logs the user, date, and time of the latest update.

✅ Integration & Visibility

The coordination call record is linked to the related training request and visible to:

Course writers (for content updates)

Trainers (for delivery adjustments)

Administrators (for tracking and client communication).

The latest coordination call appears in a Communication History section (e.g., “Scoping Call – 10/15/25”, “Coordination Call – 11/05/25”).

Users can view previous call records in read-only mode.

✅ Validation & Feedback

Missing required fields trigger an error message identifying what must be completed.

Upon successful submission, a confirmation message appears:
“Coordination call details recorded successfully.”

✅ Audit Trail (Stretch Goal)

Each coordination call entry includes a version history to track what changed since the scoping call.
