As a Training Manager or Administrator,
I want to upload or link the Statement of Work (SOW) or Contract and mark its current status,
so that the team can track whether the agreement has been sent, is awaiting signature, or has been fully executed.

Given / When / Then
Given:

A training engagement exists, and the proposal phase is complete.

When:

I select “Add SOW / Contract” from the engagement record.

Then:

I can upload or link the document (Word, PDF, or SharePoint link).

I am prompted to set the document Status as:

🟡 Pending Client Signature, or

🟢 Signed / Executed.

The SOW/Contract record displays in the engagement’s document list with the selected status.

Acceptance Criteria
✅ Upload / Link Functionality

The user can upload a file (.docx or .pdf) or provide a valid SharePoint/Drive link.

Required metadata fields:

Document Title

Status (Pending or Signed)

Upload Date (auto)

Uploaded By (auto)

Optional fields: Version, Notes, Signature Date (if Signed).

✅ Status Handling

The default status is Pending Client Signature.

Status can be updated to Signed / Executed once the client confirms.

When marked as Signed, the system:

Locks editing of that document (read-only).

Logs the change in the engagement activity feed.

Flags that engagement as “Contract Signed” for metrics.

Only Admins can revert a document from “Signed” back to “Pending.”

✅ Version Control

If a new contract replaces an older one, the prior version is archived but still viewable.

Only one SOW can hold “Signed” status per engagement.

✅ Visibility & Access

Trainers and team members can view/download the file or link.

Only Training Managers and Admins can add or update SOWs.

✅ Activity Feed Integration

Each status change is logged, e.g.:

“SOW v1.0 uploaded and marked Pending Signature.”

“SOW v1.0 updated to Signed / Executed by Alex T.”

✅ Error Handling

If the user tries to upload a file without selecting a status, display:
“Please select a document status before saving.”

✅ Success Message

After save:
“SOW / Contract uploaded successfully and marked as [Status].”
